				<br><h2>Cycloidal Gearbox II</h2>
					<h1>January 15th, 2021 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Back with the cycloidal gearboxes! I had a number of improvements to make, so let's run through them. First, the most obvious improvement was to make it an actual gearbox and not some
						fidget toy that you needed to hold together with your hands to actually use. We can check that box, as this is a pretty solid unit. Next, I needed some way to input torque into the
						gearbox without using external hardware. I designed a simple little crank which you can see in the Fusion 360 design preview box below.
					</h6>
						<br><br>
						<div class="img-right">
							<img src="img/cycloidalmarkIII1.PNG" alt="Model of cycloidal gearbox">
						</div>
					<h6>
						Additionally, I wanted to ensure you could assemble the gearbox without needing any hardware. I thought about making 3D printed snapping connectors but decided that would be too weak. Seeing
						as my main goal with this project was to demonstrate how cool the mechanism is, I just made the case threaded. Let this be a warning, do not connect this to your car to gain more torque. Very danger.

				<br><h2>A CNC Carved Volcano Incense Burner</h2>
					<h1>January 8th, 2021 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I just think topographic maps are the coolest! And you should really look up how satellites get this data. Isn't it awesome that I was able to generate a model of some part of the earth from some free online data? What
						a time to be alive. This project began after being inspired by some instagram video I saw a while back. Someone made their version on a much better CNC with better materials, so I knew I had to step it up.
					</h6>

							<img src="img/vesuvius.jpg" alt="Carved Model of VOlcano">
						</div>
					<h6>
						My big change would be an incredible level of detail. I exported the height data at the highest resolution I could and used an absolutely tiny carving bit (0.6 mm, just a little bit than a 3D printer nozzle!). It came
						out looking just remarkable. The best part was this project began life as an old 2 by 4 in my dad's garage. I used the CNC to plane one side, then squared up both pieces which left me with some great wood to work with.
						I then designed the model in Fusion 360 and made it! I can't believe a computer can do this kind of stuff.

				<br><h2>Cycloidal Gearbox</h2>
					<h1>January 5th, 2021 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I don't have much to say about this one, since it more or less speaks for itself. These gearboxes are just plain cool! The gear reduction is 1 : N where N is the number of pins you have on the outside ring. I used
						these shelf pins I had laying around, so I ended up with 20 pins. 1:20 gearbox is quite nice, and the way it works is mesmerizing.
						<br>

					<div class="img-right">
						<img src="img/Cycloidal2.jpg" alt="blinking heart">
						
					</div>
						If you haven't seen how they work, I highly recommend searching up a video. I 3D printed mine and it works great. I have some plans to make an adapter so that it will fit a NEMA17 stepper motor. I don't have any plans
						as to what I would do after that, but a high torque, low backlash gearbox could come in handy one day!

					<h6>After my recent flying wing failure, I restarted. I knew from the very beginning that this wing would be the best I could make it. I would increase the span, fill it with insulation foam, and ensure
						that the outer skin of the aircraft was left in one piece. I was going to make the most durable wing I could.
						<br>

					<div class="img-left">

				<br><h2>A Flying Wing</h2>
					<h1>November 28th, 2020 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Over the summer I had built a FT Versawing becuase I had planned on taking the electronics out of my old RC plane and giving them new life. Between now and then, FliteTest had released a flight stabilization board,
						the FT Aura Lite 5. This board was everything I had hoped for, it made the process of upgrading my hunk of foam and servos into a real capable airplane. I set out on the path to upgrade my flying wing to a state 
						of the art flying machine
						<br>

					<div class="img-right">
						<img src="img/Dorito2.jpg" alt="blinking heart">
						
					</div>
						Sadly, this project does not end well. In an effort to preserve the aerodynamics of the wing and prevent myself from adding too much drag, I cut material out of the inside to servo as a housing. However, I did not realize
						 the material I had cut away turned out to be integral to the structure of the wing. It was no longer able to be flown, but I wasn't worried. I vowed to create the most indestructible wing ever.

				<br><h2>Getting a CNC Router</h2>
					<h1>November 21st, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I have always wanted a CNC router! But they are just so large and with me moving around so much for school it just isn't viable yet to have a real CNC router. So instead I got this small one capable of cutting wood
						and even doing some damage to aluminum! I still need to figure out how to cut aluminum effectively, but first results seem promising! Just look at that airplane outline.

						I made a makeshift enclosure out of a storage container which keeps the dust in nicely. I 3D printed some anti-vibration feet which feature a velcro strap to ensure no rigid connections between the machine and the
						feet it rests on. This cuts down on vibrations, but only reduces noise a little. I suppose there is only so much you can do for something that is tearing its way through wood. I am excited to see what I will be able to create!

				<br><h2>Building a RC Long EZ</h2>
					<h1>October 4th, 2020 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Another Long EZ project! Who would have thought. Just kidding, if you know me then you know another Long EZ project was bound to happen. And after thinking through it, I figured a RC version would be easy.
						I decided to base the build around the wings, since they account for a large portion of the overall vehicle. I 3D printed some ribs and used some pieces of balsa as spars.

						This is still a work in progress as I sort through other aviation endeavours. I do plan on making this thing fly thought, mark my words. I am a bit worried about weight and balance. On real airplanes, the engine
						is one of the heaviest components. On a RC plane, this is not the case. But you do have the battery which weighs quite a bit. Long story short, I'll eventually be taking to the skies with my RC Long EZ.

					<h1>September 19th, 2020 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Of all the amazingly engineered flying machines I have purchased, this one takes the cake. While I did not build this one, it was too great not to include. It simply flies so well! Let's start with the design. Featuring
						a pusher prop configuration, say goodbye to broken propellers and dangerous grass landings which threaten your motor mount. The high wing of the Aeroscout increases stability, while also increasing its appeal. The landing gear
						is amazing (when properly used. i.e. no grass landings) and the nose gear even turns!
						<br>

					<div class="img-left">
						<img src="img/Aeroscout2.JPG" alt="blinking heart">
						
					</div>
						This was a joint venture with me and my girlfriend. It has given us both many hours of flight time and just pure fun. I did manage to crash this thing rather hard into the ground, snapping the coupler that connects the servo to the
						nose gear. But that's just a temporary setback. I plan to machine a new one and get back to scale landings with possibly the greatest flying thing I own.

					<h1>September 5th, 2020 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>The second one! Thats right. My first one is probably more glue and tape than actual airplane at this point, and the Sport Cub is just such a great little plane that how could I not get two? Truth be told, if you
						even think you would enjoy RC planes, you need to get this. The AS3x and S.A.F.E. technology that is somehow packed onto something which weighs less than a banana is insane to me.

				<br><h2>Calculating the Specific Impulse of Homemade Rocket Motors</h2>
					<h1>July 9th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Finally! A way to measure and verify my rocket motors are making any worthwhile thrust. The goal of this project was to create a test stand which would give me a time vs thrust graph of the rocket motor, so I could
						calculate specific impulse. This calculation is trivial with such a relationship and the weight of the propellant.

						And trivial it was! I was able to get quite reasonable numbers from my test stand. I made use of this luggage scale in the lever arrangement as shown. This increased the resolution of my data (i.e. if the scale could measure
						.1 lb increments and the lever had an advantage of 2, then really the scale would measure .05lb increments) and simplifed the build. I considered using a strain gauge, but figured the electronics would be too delicate for such
						a task. My motors worked! I made real working rocket motors from nothing more than stump remover and sugar.

				<br><h2>The Messenger (ESP8266 based messaging service)</h2>
					<h1>June 12th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Do you ever want to communicate with the feeling of writing a letter, but the urgency of sending a text? Probably not. But you have to admit this project is super cool! With COVID still looming into the summer, I
						wanted to invent a new way to communicate with my girlfriend. We were more than 2,000 miles away mind you, so anything to reduce the feeling of that distance would be great!

					<div class="img-right">
						<img src="img/Messenger2.jpg" alt="blinking heart">
						
					</div>
						So what I came up with is a messenging website that works with an ESP8266 microcontroller. First, the message is input on a subdomain of this website. Then it is sent to a secret storage space which the ESP8266 can access.
						In between sending the message and accessing it, the message is encrypted with a laughable encryption algorithm. It was easy to write in both PHP and C++, so I'm not complaining. Then it is displayed on an Eink display.
						A nice blue LED flashes when there is a new message and a button is used to dismiss. Overall, it works great! I am so happy with how it turned out!

				<br><h2> Turning an Old 3D Printer Into a Plotter</h2>
					<h1>May 24th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Back at Purdue, I was able to procure an old 3D printer for about $50. It ran on what looked to be some custom Arduino Mega shield, so I was unable to find any schematics or details. 
						The auto bed leveling did not work, which further complicated matters. I was able to get one nice print though, it was an articulating butterfly. For what I was working with, it came out well!
					</h6>

				<div class="img-right">
					<img src="img/butterfly.jpg" alt="image of 3D printed butterfly">
				</div>

					<br><h6>So, I didn't have much to work with. I decided to turn the printer into a plotter. I figured the inability to use the limit switches (remember, auto leveling was broke) would allow me to still
						create gcode which would draw something. In a way, I removed one of the dimensions and turned the 3D printer into a 2D printer. Despite this apparent step backwards, I made a ton of cards and posters which
						look great!

				<br><h2> Displaying the Time With a Single Seven Segment Display</h2>
					<h1>May 19th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>The goal for this project was to use the asbolute smallest amount of hardware to build a clock. Sounds silly, but I thought using a single seven segment display would give me the challenge I was looking for. Plus they are just
						so simple! Seven LEDs organized to form 10 different digits. All universally understood regardless of langauge. Perhaps I am being overdramatic but those are some important and well designed LEDs.

						<br><br>

						My plan was to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to access the time from the internet. Sure, you could buy a realtime clock module for the arduino, but my goal was minimalism! I made a little animation that played everytime the time was
						about to be displayed, digit for digit. This sequence ran through until the ESP was able to access the internet to get the current time again. It works extremely well! I honestly think this could make for a cool futuristic watch. Although
						I would replace the seven segment since it looks a bit hacked together. Maybe I'll launch my own brand of watches. I'll call it Watch & Learn (Get it? You're watching the watch and learning the time? Okay maybe I'll find another company name).

				<br><h2> Mindstorms Inspired Turtle Robot</h2>
					<h1>May 12th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Mindstorms by Seymour Papert is one of the best books I have ever read. It simply can't be described in words so if you are looking for something to read, find a copy. The purpose of this project was to make a robot that would
						use its own type of code to draw primitive shapes and lines. For example, [LINE 10] would draw a 10cm straight line
 
						<br><br>

						This project is still a work in progress. I originally wanted to find a way to determine the location of my wheels, therefore making the robot more accurate, but this proved difficult. Facing this challenge, I googled what other people
						were doing to solve this problem. It turns out stepper motors would work well for this purpose. However, I don't have any stepper motors. So, much like my other projects, I plan to be lazy and embrace the added constraints.

				<br><h2> Controlling a Four Digit Seven Segment Display</h2>
					<h1>April 20th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Here is a project born out pure laziness. When you control one of these four digit seven segment displays, you are supposed to use a shift register so that you can sequentially write data to each digit while making
						sure only one digit is lit up. This process is similar to multiplexing and is quite mesmerizing when you really understand how it works. But I don't have a shift register. Nor do I feel a project of mine should be limited
						by its absence. So I thought I would bootleg one using an ESP microcontoller.
						<br><br>
						Instead of using a shift register, I just had the ESP turn on and off each digit until I got the same effect. And it works great! Granted, I need 7 + N number of pins for N digits, instead of the 8 I would need with a shift register,
						but I think imporivsing is an art. And I am an artist.

					<h1>April 12th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I'm not entirely sure when it happened, but I became obsessed with tensegrity structures. Especially 3D printed ones. After observing their relatively simple nature, I decided to try to make my own. My design came with
						one key stipulation though: It needed to be portable. I wanted to mail this print across the country so I needed to ensure it could fit in an envelope. Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to make a giant, chair sized
						tensegrity structure and mail it out in a wooden crate. But I like a challenge.
						<br><br>
						The central tower in the middle of my triangular design merely slots in place (adding another level to its tensile integrity). I then connected everything with some lovely blue twine, completing the structure. A giant one
						I find online is pictured in the back while my own work of art is in the foreground. I also added a fractal pattern to each base because, well, I can. It is 3D printing. The build volume's the limit!

					<h1>April 10th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I love a good Long EZ. Such a simple, yet stunning kit plane, made by the aerospace legend Burt Rutan. If there is one engineer I wish to meet, Mr. Rutan would be the guy. This model was found on thingiverse, so I can't claim
						to have any part in designing it. I did create a cavity to house the electronics and lights thought, which was one of the most important parts of the build. I wanted to make this 3D printed model into almost a work of art.

					</div>
					I also designed my own circuit for this model. It included a small quadcopter motor that would allow the prop on the back of the model to be functional. I added some navgiation lights and made them blink by reusing parts 
					of the blinking heart circuit. This turned out great and makes a lovely tribute to one of my favorite planes of all time!

				<br><h2> Designing a Monolithic Pill Container</h2>
					<h1>March 28th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Look around us. Everything we see, touch, interact with, depend on, has been designed. Meaning someone took the idea they had in their head, combined it with the constraints of the real world, and produced something
						that we humans use with no second thought. Even objects as simple as forks have such deep roots in product design. I mean, why do they have four tines instead of five? Tangent aside, I wanted to try my hand at improving a basic everyday
						item: A pill container. 
						<br><br>
						Lucky for me, my constraints were relatively simple. Hold pills. Don't let the pills go. Have slots for each day of the week, and each half of the day if I so choose. My main goal with this design was to make it one piece or monolithic. This
						would greatly reduce manufacturing time and eliminate the need for assembly. 3D printing is obviously not the manufacturing workhorse I'm pretending it is, but sometimes its fun to pretend and run with it. Plus, if a technology like SLA improves, 
						this pill container could be manufactured rapidly (SLA print times only depend on the height of the object. Since this is relatively small in height, so is the time to manufacture).

					<h6>If you know anything about electronics, look away! In all seriousness, I think this is one of the best things I have ever made! The whole goal of this project was to make an interactive 3D printed electronic sculpture to
						gift to my girlfriend. We had been separated due to COVID and I wanted to find a way to make that distance feel a bit smaller.

						<img src="img/BlinkingHeart3.jpg" alt="blinking heart">
						
					</div>
						I used Fusion 360 to design the model and built the circuit on a breadboard. I somehow came up with a modified blinking circuit which commonly uses 555 timers such that a little current was always flowing through, 
						and periodically some more would be let in. This produced a wonderful heartbeat effect. I finalized the design by including a tilt sensor which detects when the heart is in its upright position to turn it on.

					<h6>There is something special about making a plane out of balsa. Of course, there is something special about making a plane out of anything, but making one out of wood just feels different. I feel like a Wright Brother,
						readying the flyer for a short skip over the hills of Kittyhawk. That might be a bit dramatic, but I always enjoy making planes out of balsa wood.
						<br><br>

						This plane is special though. My girlfriend painted the nose of a P-40 on some pieces of balsa to act as nose weight. Normally, I would use a coin, or paper clips, but in this case the decorative nose balanced the plane
						perfectly. And wouldn't you know. It flew perfectly. I mean this was the best flying glider I had ever made, and it has such significance that it might be my favorite plane!

					<h6>Finally, a use for all those rocket motors I had been making. Since I chose to use some random PVC laying around for the motors, I had a nonstandard size. I decided the perfect solution would be to 3D print a
						rocket which would accept these new motors. The only issue was that 3D printers use plastic. And plastic is known to melt at high temperatures. My solutioin was to just make it really thick! What could go wrong.
						<br>

					<div class="img-right">
						<img src="img/3dprintedrocket2.JPG" alt="model of rocket">
					</div>

						Well, it turns out alot. The motor mount broke from the impulsive force of the motor. In hindsight, this is obvious since the weakest axis of the motor mounts would be colinear with the axis of thrust. What a fool! Of course
						I learned my lesson and it is safe to say I will be even more careful with how I design my parts in the future.

					<h6>More rockets! I just can't get enough. Who doesn't love a good display of Newton's Laws and physics? The goal with this batch was to perfect my method. I wanted the fastest burn time, with the largest amount of thrust
						possible. This feat wasn't easy however, I had no way of measuring the thrust! So, I mainly focused on measuring the burn time. The rocket shown in the picture worked a bit too well. It burned so fast and hot 
						that it melted the PVC pipe which acted as the motor housing! 
						<br><br>

						My goals for this project were to eventually launch a rocket to a precise altitude by measuring various parameters of the rocket such as weight, drag, and thrust force.

						and I had some inspiration. I designed a little mount to hold a pen on my Ender 3 and then searched the internet for some way to transform images into computer talk.
						<br><br>

						This worked well but it was slow. I figured out eventually that someone made a post processor for Fusion 360, so I started to use that and it worked great! I was now able to print in 2 dimensions, as well as 3.

						<br><br>

						When the event I was working was winding down, we had extra time and material. I decided to make a symbolic representation of this event and put the Purdue emblem on a gear shape. I figured nothing would be more

					<h1>September 6th, 2019 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>

					<h6>This is a big day for me! I finally branched out and investigated a new form of 3D printing. StereoLithography Apparatus is pretty cool, a vat of resin is exposed to UV radiation which selectively cures different parts of the resin.
						Instead of the resolution depending on the size of the nozzle, the resolution here depends on a screen, similar to the screen you are viewing this website on. For this reason, SLA prints come out much cleaner at smaller sizes.

						<br><br>

						This isn't as involved as my other projects, but it was too cool not to share. I mean look how far technology has come! Even SLA printers are starting to become a desktop commodity. The only issue is that the resin is fairly toxic and
						gross. You really don't want this stuff getting on your hands. But when you have the facilities, you can make some really great prints, just like this one!

						<br><br>

						I just couldn't get my raspberry pi to connedt to the wifi at Purdue. It was something about the dorm wifi that wouldn't let me install the necessary programs or something. So I vow to return to this project 
						when I one day have more stable wifi. One day.

						In this next photo you can see some serious force! The launch that followed this epic leap into the air managed to go clear over my house. I never thought something I would whip together with duct tape and 
						an old soda bottle would fly this well. I also calculated the coefficient of drag for each rocket, but I forget what I got.

				<br><h2>Fighter Jet Tiles</h2>
					<h1>November 12th, 2017 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Pretty simple, but fun. I had some old tiles and some pieces of rock and glass that I needed something to do with. I thought what would be better than a fighter jet mosaic! A perfect combination of art and reuse, 
						I figured I could always cover the tiles in expoxy and make some coasters as well. I started off with two interesting planes, the F-35 and the Eurofighter Typhoon. I sketched them on the tile
						and then found some pieces to compose the aircraft.

					<h6>
						They turned out really well! I only had a few pieces to make the jet exhuast, so I had to improvise. Using the small glass beads as cockpits was also a nice touch, mixing up the materials and bringing it all together.

				<br><h2>Making a Terrarium with a Light Bulb</h2>
					<h1>May 6th, 2017 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I have always liked terrariums. There is something so cool about a mini self supporting ecosystem that you can hold in your hand. That being said, a terrarium is quite difficult without the proper equipment and knowledge.
						Neither of which I had when I made this one. But fear not, this terrarium lasted nearly a year before suddenly dying. I'm sure it was something like the nitrogen in the soil or some other small detail which was easy to overlook. 
						I never claimed to know what I'm doing!

					<h6>
						I even had a little worm which was stuck in the soil I added! I'm not sure how the little guy did, but I'm sure he was having the time of his life being one of few relatively large organisms in there. I find it interesting
						just how simultaneously fragile and durable life is. Some fish die because there isn't enough salt in the water but this worm lived for nearly a year in a lightbulb. Odd.

				<br><h2>Launching a 98% Homemade Model Rocket! </h2>
					<h1>July 12th, 2016 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Aweeee yeah, another model rocket. I can't even tell you how many I launched prior to this one, or how many I launched after this one. Either way, this one was awesome. It used 2 estes C motors, ripping
						of the pad with all its thrust. I also spray painted it with a combination of grays, giving it a cool gunmetal look.
						
						<br><br>

						Did I mention I made almost all of it from scratch? Everything but the motors were scavenged from my house. From the trash bag parachute to the paper towel tube motor mounts, everything was repurposed and improvised.
						And it turned out great! Turns out you don't need the most expensive rocket parts in the world to make something that flies great.

				<br><h2>Seeing Every Space Shuttle (Atlantis, Endeavour, Enterprise, Discovery)</h2>
					<h1>June 23rd, 2016 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>One day, I learned what the word bucket list meant. And I figured I should have one right? It seems like everyone does and it would be nice to have a big goal I could work towards. The only item on my bucket list 
						was to see all four remaining Space Shuttles. This meant going to California, Florida, New York, and Viriginia, not an easy task and certainly something that would take some time.
						
						<br><br>

						I am happy to report that on June 23rd, I completed my quest with Enteprise in New York! While Enterprise never went to space, I still think it played a fundamental role in the shuttle program and is important. 
						If you haven't been, I highly recommend the Intrepid Air and Space Museum in New York. I love all planes, but the ones there are just spectacular.

				<br><h2>Strapping a Camera to a Rocket!</h2>
					<h1>December 15th, 2015 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>This video is just plain awesome. Yet, I still can't figure out how to get it off the SD card. I believe the card got corrupted by whatever cheap camera I used so the best I can do is screenshots of the video playing
						on my computer. It pains me to do such a thing, but such is life. Seeing this footage was so cool to me! I built this rocket myself, so seeing it fly was already special. But feeling like I was inside of it as it
						lifted off and headed skyward was something even cooler.

						<br><br>

						The flight was perfect. I headed off into the wind and gently floated back down coming nearly perfectly back to the launch pad. And the rocket flew really well. I know it was a kit but it is so nice to see something just work.
						This video is great although I am sad I lost it.

				<br><h2>Composing a Song (For the Steel Drums)</h2>
					<h1>October 2nd, 2015 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I wrote a song! And before you even hear it, just know that it is not good. I'm sure the good souls who formalized music theory are rolling in their graves right now at the fact that this thing exists, but I found a great website
						to use to make the piece and so I had to give it a go. I honestly can't remember what the inspiration or goal for this was but I think it came out okay-ish.

					<h6>One of my first projects ever. This is so old that I can't even place what date it would've been around. All I know is I was about 12 or 13 and wanted a way to reuse all the pop cans I saw laying around our neighboyhood.
						I thought what better way, than to pay tribute to some of my favorite flying machines! Shown here, I have my F-18 Hornet and the BAC Concorde. I think the F-18 looks amazing, although I should have increased the scale of the
						Concorde. But whats a 12-13 year old to do?
