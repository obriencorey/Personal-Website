				<br><h2>A CNC Carved Volcano Incense Burner</h2>
					<h1>January 4th, 2021 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I just think topographic maps are the coolest! And you should really look up how satellites get this data. Isn't it awesome that I was able to generate a model of some part of the earth from some free online data? What
						a time to be alive. This project began after being inspired by some instagram video I saw a while back. Someone made their version on a much better CNC with better materials, so I knew I had to step it up.

						</div>
					<h6>
						My big change would be an incredible level of detail. I exported the height data at the highest resolution I could and used an absolutely tiny carving bit (0.6 mm, just a little bit than a 3D printer nozzle!). It came
						out looking just remarkable. The best part was this project began life as an old 2 by 4 in my dad's garage. I used the CNC to plane one side, then squared up both pieces which left me with some great wood to work with.
						I then designed the model in Fusion 360 and made it! I can't believe a computer can do this kind of stuff.

				<br><h2> Turning an Old 3D Printer Into a Plotter</h2>
					<h1>May 24th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Back at Purdue, I was able to procure an old 3D printer for about $50. It ran on what looked to be some custom Arduino Mega shield, so I was unable to find any schematics or details. 
						The auto bed leveling did not work, which further complicated matters. I was able to get one nice print though, it was an articulating butterfly. For what I was working with, it came out well!
					</h6>

				<div class="img-right">
					<img src="img/butterfly.jpg" alt="image of 3D printed butterfly">
				</div>

					<br><h6>So, I didn't have much to work with. I decided to turn the printer into a plotter. I figured the inability to use the limit switches (remember, auto leveling was broke) would allow me to still
						create gcode which would draw something. In a way, I removed one of the dimensions and turned the 3D printer into a 2D printer. Despite this apparent step backwards, I made a ton of cards and posters which
						look great!

				<br><h2> Displaying the Time With a Single Seven Segment Display</h2>
					<h1>May 19th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>The goal for this project was to use the asbolute smallest amount of hardware to build a clock. Sounds silly, but I thought using a single seven segment display would give me the challenge I was looking for. Plus they are just
						so simple! Seven LEDs organized to form 10 different digits. All universally understood regardless of langauge. Perhaps I am being overdramatic but those are some important and well designed LEDs.

						<br><br>

						My plan was to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to access the time from the internet. Sure, you could buy a realtime clock module for the arduino, but my goal was minimalism! I made a little animation that played everytime the time was
						about to be displayed, digit for digit. This sequence ran through until the ESP was able to access the internet to get the current time again. It works extremely well! I honestly think this could make for a cool futuristic watch. Although
						I would replace the seven segment since it looks a bit hacked together. Maybe I'll launch my own brand of watches. I'll call it Watch & Learn (Get it? You're watching the watch and learning the time? Okay maybe I'll find another company name).

				<br><h2> Mindstorms Inspired Turtle Robot</h2>
					<h1>May 12th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Mindstorms by Seymour Papert is one of the best books I have ever read. It simply can't be described in words so if you are looking for something to read, find a copy. The purpose of this project was to make a robot that would
						use its own type of code to draw primitive shapes and lines. For example, [LINE 10] would draw a 10cm straight line
 
						<br><br>

						This project is still a work in progress. I originally wanted to find a way to determine the location of my wheels, therefore making the robot more accurate, but this proved difficult. Facing this challenge, I googled what other people
						were doing to solve this problem. It turns out stepper motors would work well for this purpose. However, I don't have any stepper motors. So, much like my other projects, I plan to be lazy and embrace the added constraints.

				<br><h2> Controlling a Four Digit Seven Segment Display</h2>
					<h1>April 20th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Here is a project born out pure laziness. When you control one of these four digit seven segment displays, you are supposed to use a shift register so that you can sequentially write data to each digit while making
						sure only one digit is lit up. This process is similar to multiplexing and is quite mesmerizing when you really understand how it works. But I don't have a shift register. Nor do I feel a project of mine should be limited
						by its absence. So I thought I would bootleg one using an ESP microcontoller.
						<br><br>
						Instead of using a shift register, I just had the ESP turn on and off each digit until I got the same effect. And it works great! Granted, I need 7 + N number of pins for N digits, instead of the 8 I would need with a shift register,
						but I think imporivsing is an art. And I am an artist.

				<br><h2> Creating My Own Tensegrity Structure (Portable Edition)</h2>
					<h1>April 12th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I'm not entirely sure when it happened, but I became obsessed with tensegrity structures. Especially 3D printed ones. After observing their relatively simple nature, I decided to try to make my own. My design came with
						one key stipulation though: It needed to be portable. I wanted to mail this print across the country so I needed to ensure it could fit in an envelope. Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to make a giant, chair sized
						tensegrity structure and mail it out in a wooden crate. But I like a challenge.
						<br><br>
						The central tower in the middle of my triangular design merely slots in place (adding another level to its tensile integrity). I then connected everything with some lovely blue twine, completing the structure. A giant one
						I find online is pictured in the back while my own work of art is in the foreground. I also added a fractal pattern to each base because, well, I can. It is 3D printing. The build volume's the limit!

				<br><h2> Designing a Monolithic Pill Container</h2>
					<h1>March 28th, 2020 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Look around us. Everything we see, touch, interact with, depend on, has been designed. Meaning someone took the idea they had in their head, combined it with the constraints of the real world, and produced something
						that we humans use with no second thought. Even objects as simple as forks have such deep roots in product design. I mean, why do they have four tines instead of five? Tangent aside, I wanted to try my hand at improving a basic everyday
						item: A pill container. 
						<br><br>
						Lucky for me, my constraints were relatively simple. Hold pills. Don't let the pills go. Have slots for each day of the week, and each half of the day if I so choose. My main goal with this design was to make it one piece or monolithic. This
						would greatly reduce manufacturing time and eliminate the need for assembly. 3D printing is obviously not the manufacturing workhorse I'm pretending it is, but sometimes its fun to pretend and run with it. Plus, if a technology like SLA improves, 
						this pill container could be manufactured rapidly (SLA print times only depend on the height of the object. Since this is relatively small in height, so is the time to manufacture).

				<br><h2>Planes Made Out of Balsa</h2>
					<h1>February 17th, 2020 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>There is something special about making a plane out of balsa. Of course, there is something special about making a plane out of anything, but making one out of wood just feels different. I feel like a Wright Brother,
						readying the flyer for a short skip over the hills of Kittyhawk. That might be a bit dramatic, but I always enjoy making planes out of balsa wood.
						<br><br>

						This plane is special though. My girlfriend painted the nose of a P-40 on some pieces of balsa to act as nose weight. Normally, I would use a coin, or paper clips, but in this case the decorative nose balanced the plane
						perfectly. And wouldn't you know. It flew perfectly. I mean this was the best flying glider I had ever made, and it has such significance that it might be my favorite plane!

				<br><h2>Turning My Ender 3 Into a Plotter</h2>
					<h1>December 24th, 2019 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I got this idea one night in my sleep. What if I removed a dimension from my 3D printer. Silly I know, but I just had to prove it could be done. Luckily, a quick google search told me other people had felt the same way
						and I had some inspiration. I designed a little mount to hold a pen on my Ender 3 and then searched the internet for some way to transform images into computer talk.
						<br><br>

						This worked well but it was slow. I figured out eventually that someone made a post processor for Fusion 360, so I started to use that and it worked great! I was now able to print in 2 dimensions, as well as 3. 
						What a time to be alive.

				<br><h2>Laser Cutting a Custom Purdue Gear</h2>
					<h1>October 20th, 2019 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>If you know me, you know I love 3D printers. But 3D only cover one base of CNC manufacturing. There is so much more out there to explore and enjoy - like laser cutters. I was given the amazing opportunity
						to work at the Bechtel Innovation and Design Center (BIDC) at Purdue. I was in charge of 3D printers and the laser cutter.
						<br><br>

						When the event I was working was winding down, we had extra time and material. I decided to make a symbolic representation of this event and put the Purdue emblem on a gear shape. I figured nothing would be more
						fitting. Plus, who doesn't love gears. This is the first thing I ever laser cut for myself!

					<h1>September 26th, 2019 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I love these things! They're so cute and well engineered. The little rocker-bogey-esque mechanism which enables them to go up small curbs. And they deliver food! I have never used their service, since I feel bad.
						However, that doesn't mean they aren't cute. And I wanted to make a model of one!
						<br><br>
						<div class="img-left">

							<img src="img/Starship2.jpg" alt="3d Model of starship robot">

						I made the whole thing in Fusion 360. This program is great for making models to 3D print. There is a much shallower learning curve than for most other CAD programs and it lets you do quite a bit. For example,
						the model of the Starship robot. I really need to find a better way to print the parts however, as the layer lines are quite obvious.

				<br><h2> My First SLA Print!</h2>
					<h1>September 6th, 2019 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>This is a big day for me! I finally branched out and investigated a new form of 3D printing. StereoLithography Apparatus is pretty cool, a vat of resin is exposed to UV radiation which selectively cures different parts of the resin.
						Instead of the resolution depending on the size of the nozzle, the resolution here depends on a screen, similar to the screen you are viewing this website on. For this reason, SLA prints come out much cleaner at smaller sizes.

						<br><br>

						This isn't as involved as my other projects, but it was too cool not to share. I mean look how far technology has come! Even SLA printers are starting to become a desktop commodity. The only issue is that the resin is fairly toxic and
						gross. You really don't want this stuff getting on your hands. But when you have the facilities, you can make some really great prints, just like this one!

				<br><h2> Raspberry Pi Magic Mirror (To Be Continued)</h2>
					<h1>August 25th, 2019 (West Lafayette, Indiana)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I have always wanted to make a magic mirror. The basic premise is that you stuff a computer monitor behind a one way mirror and have it display useful information. It could tell you the weather, display the movement
						of some of your stocks, or tell you a joke everyday. It is a relatively simple project, requiring a raspberry pi and some wifi. The wifi is the part I over looked.
						<br><br>

						I just couldn't get my raspberry pi to connedt to the wifi at Purdue. It was something about the dorm wifi that wouldn't let me install the necessary programs or something. So I vow to return to this project 
						when I one day have more stable wifi. One day.

					<h6>I just want to say that the pattern I used for this clock is taken directly from a Gucci handbag. But I really don't think I am negatively impacting Gucci sales, plus I don't plan on selling this clock, so I figured
						this was okay. Overlooking that, this came out nice! I brought together just about every trick in my metaphorical 3D printing bag for this one. From my multicolor technique to ensuring proper printing orientation.

					<br><h6>I had two major set backs. The first was my Fusion 360 file got messed up with no fix in sight. I believe it was my fault because I tried to scale a relatively complex sketch, but eithe way it was no fun! Then, my print failed,
						after I had already done the multi color technique! This was several hours nearly down the drain. Luckily, I was able to print the part that was missing and use a 3D printing pen to glue them back together. Sometimes it pays to design
						simple parts.

						and it took quite a bit to convince my mother, but eventually I made some. 

						<br><br>

						This story does not have a happy ending sadly. I didn't add a launch rod so when the wind hit the rocket it tipped. And I just happened to light the rocket before the wind hit it. And I only had one motor. Alot of lessons

						to real artists. I hope to make up this shortcoming by this project turning out really cool! I mean just look at it. Just some simple lines of melted plastic on a nicely colored wall and we have some real art.

						<br><br>

						As for the pen I used, I can't remember. I sometimes use it to weld 3D printed parts back together when they break, but I don't think the brand matters. They all claim to do the same thing, with varying levels of success.
						Melt plastic and push it through a small orfice to precisely deposit plastic.

						<br><br>

						This printer has been through many upgrades, breakdowns, and changes. The hot end, board, fans, build plate, and extruder have all been swapped out. I added LEDs, a convert to power them, a flexible filament extruder
						upgrade, and 3D printed inserts into the extrusions to make it look nice.

					<br>

					<h6>One of my best 3D printer projects to date! I thought it would be great to make a candle using a mold I 3D printed. I could make any shape I wanted! The possibilities are endless. Well not really, because
						the shape would have to be castable. And seeing as I wanted to make it a two piece mold, the possibilities are not entirely endless. Either way, there is alot!

						<br><br>

						Unfortunately, I did not do my math right. I needed to split apart the candle to make it come out. However, this was an easy fix as the candle was made of wax (obviously). I could just melt it and reform it. 
						Which is exactly what I did. I also added lavender essential oil! It smells great although the biggest problem is I just can't bring myself to burn it! It looks too good.

					<h6>This was such a cool project and I still incorporate this technique into many projects I work on. The basic premise is simple, you just make different 3D models for each color and print them together. 
						There is the basic limitation that the print needs to have a plane on the bottom to permit this technique.

						<br><br>

						Despite this limitation, I have managed to squeeze this fancy technique into many of my prints. It just makes the print look more professional and finished. Not to mention, its just awesome a computer can do this!

					<h6>Wow. I am writing this after the fact of course, since I started this website in 2019, but wow. If you know me, you know that 3D printing is integral to my identity and personality and everything. I am 3D printing. 
						I have used up more than a kilometer of filament since this date and I don't plan on stopping soon. My room, my apartment, and every space inbetween is littered with things I have 3D printed.
						<br><br>

						This is my first print by the way. It is the basic calibration print that comes with my Monoprice printer, but it came out great. I showed this to everyone I remotely knew. Stopped at a red light? You know
						I'm pulling this bad boy out to show the car next to me. On the bus? You bet I'm striking up a conversation about how a computer melted plastic to produce this thing.

				<br><h2> Building a Foamboard Airplane</h2>
					<h1>June 17th, 2018 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>My first foamboard airplane. Foreshadowing a long line of aircraft made of the great material, this one was a kit from FliteTest. If you haven't heard of FliteTest and have even a remote interest in things that fly, then what are you doing! Jokes
						aside, I think FliteTest is doing amazing things bringing aviation to kids and schools. I know I'm biased, but planes are pretty awesome. 

						<br><br>

						This plane is gone. I retired it in 2020, as the airframe was almost useless and I needed the electronics. But it served me quite well. Granted, my receiver was probably weaker than a garage door opener so rapid dives into the ground
						were common, she flew well! I will never forget the feeling of seeing something I make fly. I want to do that for a living!

				<br><h2>Making a Paper Model of a Falcon 9 Rocket (Carrying TESS)</h2>
					<h1>May 3rd, 2018 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>This wonderful model comes from a website called AXM Paper Scale Models. The models from this website are just top notch. No details are left out as the amazing geometry of the Falcon 9 is brought into the paper world.
						Building this was also a blast! It was the perfect level of difficulty and required a lot of thinking and planning to produce a decent model.

						<br><br>

						If you have built model aircraft before, I would recommend this. If you haven't touched a model in your life, I would recommend this. Simply put, this is the perfect introduction or continuation to modeling.

				<br><h2> My First Sport Cub RC Plane</h2>
					<h1>April 14th, 2018 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>One of my first decent RC airplanes! This thing is amazing, whoever engineered it clearly knew what they were doing and created an amazing flying experience for everyone. It has gyroscopes and intertial sensors
						to enable the plane to right itself in flight. It has three modes with varying degree of computer assistance to truly breed the next generation of RC airplane pilots.
						<br><br>

						I unfortunately don't have any good pictures of this one. I guess I was just too excited to fly!

				<br><h2> I Got a DJI Spark!</h2>
					<h1>March 10th, 2018 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Quite possibly the coolest thing I have that flies, the DJI Spark is an engineering work of art. I mean its easy to tell when the design of an object is top priority to the company selling it and we often say things are "well-engineered" but I
						have never seen something so well designed! The app that you use to control and view the drone with is simple, contains everything you need to fly and create aerial works of art, and its not cluttered as I would expect.

						<br><br>

						I am writing this after I got the drone, so I can already speak about how well it performs. Did you know that if it loses signal, it gains altitude (Up until 400 feet agl) and flies back to its launch point. I mean what a genius piece
						of software to implement. That wouldn't even be hard to code, and yet I have a feeling it is a minute detail many of DJI's competitors would overlook. This thing rocks! And I can't wait to see where else I will take it.

				<br><h2>Making Some Air Launch Rockets</h2>
					<h1>January 21st, 2018 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>Air launch rockets are great! I mean, they're pretty great. My original plan was to use hydrazine to make some liquid fuel rockets but my mom seemed against that. Jokes aside, this was a fun little project. 
						The math behind air launch rockets are great because they are just projectiles so the math works out well.
						<br><br>

						</div>

						In this next photo you can see some serious force! The launch that followed this epic leap into the air managed to go clear over my house. I never thought something I would whip together with duct tape and 
						an old soda bottle would fly this well. I also calculated the coefficient of drag for each rocket, but I forget what I got.

				<br><h2>Making a Terrarium with a Light Bulb</h2>
					<h1>May 6th, 2017 (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h1>
					<br>

					<h6>I have always liked terrariums. There is something so cool about a mini self supporting ecosystem that you can hold in your hand. That being said, a terrarium is quite difficult without the proper equipment and knowledge.
						Neither of which I had when I made this one. But fear not, this terrarium lasted nearly a year before suddenly dying. I'm sure it was something like the nitrogen in the soil or some other small detail which was easy to overlook. 
						I never claimed to know what I'm doing!

					<h6>
						I even had a little worm which was stuck in the soil I added! I'm not sure how the little guy did, but I'm sure he was having the time of his life being one of few relatively large organisms in there. I find it interesting
						just how simultaneously fragile and durable life is. Some fish die because there isn't enough salt in the water but this worm lived for nearly a year in a lightbulb. Odd.
