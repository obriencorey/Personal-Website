							<h2> AAE - </h2>
							<h3> Undergraduate Research (Manufacturing and Testing Multifunctional Sensors)</h3>
							<hr>
							<h6> One of the best aspects of Purdue is how many opportunities there are just a few questions away. I was extremely fortunate to gain hands on experience
								through this research assistance and made many valuable connections with graduate students. I was even able to play an integral role by designing a small machine
								to measure material to length, which was previously a tedious process.

						<div class="coursecard-wrap">
						  <div class="coursecard">
							<h2>AE30100 - </h2>
									<h3>Signal Analysis For Aerospace Engineering</h3>
									<hr>
									<h6> This class was plain cool. In much the same way that I thought that thermodynamics was cool, since it really made me feel like an engineer. There is something
										about signals and controls that made even some of the most mundane aspects of this class feel interesting. I enjoyed the final project, which allowed us to design 
										a state space controller for a thrust vectoring rocket.

						<div class="coursecard-wrap">
						  <div class="coursecard">
							<h2>AAE33300 - </h2>
							<h3>Fluid Mechanics</h3>
							<hr>
							<h6> People oftne say fluid mechanics is hard and I have to say they aren't wrong. While this class was more difficult than most of the classes I have taken before, the difficulty
								was worth it as you really felt like you were solving real problems. At the same time, this class showed just how complicated real life is and how many approximations we must
								make due with.

						<div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
							  <h2> AAE30000 - </h2>
							  <h3>Junior Seminar</h3>
							  <hr>
							  <h6> This class was an 8 week seminar that took place during the latter half of the semester with focuses on some of the important soft skills engineers should have. For example, 
								  one of the topics was on diversity and inclusion, and another was on ethics. 
							  </h6>
							</div>
						  </div>

						  <div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
								<h2> AAE33301 - </h2>
									<h3>Fluid Mechanics Lab</h3>
									<hr>
									<h6> I love the labs at Purdue. Not only is there the inherent cool feeling you get using decade old machines and fixtures, but you gain a hands-on perspective of the material
										you typically only learn about in textbooks. This lab had an emphasis on aerodynamics, while some of the investigations used water as the fluid. We measured the head loss of pipe
										systems and the coefficient of drag of about anything we could stick in the wind tunnel.

						  <div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
								<h2> AAE35200 - </h2>
								<h3>Structural Analysis I</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>Much like fluid mechanics, this course showed just how much we need to approximate when it comes to analyzing complex systems. However, I found the derivations and theory behind
									the topics we learned fascinating, especially considering how much of it is used on structures we interact with everyday. This course also introducted fracture mechanics with concepts
									akin to those presented by Griffith in famous investigation on the properties of glass.

							<h2> AAE20400 - </h2>
							<h3> Aeromechanics II</h3>

							<h6> Aeromechanics II is the mechanics of materials, sometimes called solid body mechanics. I enjoyed this class, with some of my favorite parts being
								beam analysis, graphing equations of displacement, and solving interesting statics problems.
							</h6>

						  <div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
							  <h2> AAE25100 - </h2>
							  <h3> Introduction to Aerospace Design</h3>
							  <hr>
							  <h6>This course was a sophomore design project class which put fellow engineering students in groups to design either a
								space or air system. I chose the aircraft, since I felt that atmospheric flight has more room for creative spin and variance. I had a ton
								of fun and a really great group!

							  <h2> EAPS10600 - </h2>
							  <h3>Geosciences Cinema</h3>
							  <hr>
							  <h6>This course was chosen because the professor was historically known to
								be one of the best at Purdue and the class was known to be tons of fun and learning. Both of these claims were true, this is one of my 
								favorite courses I have taken at Purdue and I now know why
								hurricanes don't form at the equator.

							  <h3>Honors Peer Mentoring</h3>
							  <hr>
							  <h6>This course allowed experienced engineering students to give back to the program by mentoring new students. I was given four students
								to support through their first semester at Purdue and more importantly, their first semester as engineering students. It has always been a goal 
								for me to give back to the program which has given me so much and this was a great chance to do so.

						  <div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
							  <h2> MA26600 - </h2>
							  <h3>Ordinary Differential Equations</h3>
							  <hr>
							  <h6>Differential equations are some of the coolest aspects of math. In this course, we mainly covered first and second order equations, 
								 eventually moving into homogeneous systems of equations towards the end. I also really enjoyed the computer projects which combined what you learned
								 and your programming skills to illustrate just how computationally complex DEs can be. 
							  </h6>

						  </div>

						  <div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
							  <h2> MA34100 - </h2>
							  <h3>Foundations of Analysis</h3>
							  <hr>
							  <h6>The first thing my professor said to the class on our first day was "if you are an engineer, you are going to hate this class."
								I actually chose to take this class though, as it is not part of the aero curriculum and I enjoy math. I learned a great deal about how
								to be rigorous in math and I will always think of things from a real analysis perspective from now on.

								<h3>  Technical Writing</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>(Course Taken at Community College of Allegheney County) This course was one of the few courses I would be able to take over the Summer of 2020.
									Due to a scholarship that could only be used in the state of Pennsylvania, I took this class to be able to take higher level aero classes at Purdue later on.

								<h2> ECON25100 - </h2>
								<h3>Microeconomics</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>(Course Taken at Community College of Allegheney County) This course was the principles of economics and a variety of economic theory. I enjoyed this class
									because while I had a great intuition about many of the relationships in economics, there was some simple ways to thoroughly explain those relationships which I
									found elegant.

								<h2>AAE20300 - </h2>
								<h3>Aeromechanics I</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>This was my first AAE course at Purdue! Since it was a Summer course it was taught at an accelerated rate. This class taught
									many of the fundamental physics concepts which are invaluable to an aerospace engineer. We also learned the "Basic Kinematic Equation,"
									a Purdue coined term for a simplication of Euler equations for motion. Additionally, this course introduced statics and solving for reaction forces,
									a skill that would be essential for AAE20400.

							<h2>ME20000 - </h2>
								<h3>Thermodynamics I</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>This course was one of my favorite at Purdue! Known for being notoriously hard, I took this course two semesters early as I had already finished a great
									number of first year engineering required classes. This course was one of the first times I felt like I was actually learning engineering. I learned both the First
									and Second Law of Thermodynamics, as well as powerful concepts that can be used to analyze real life systems. Most of all, I learned how to look at a complex problem fundamentally and 
									think carefully about my steps to finding a solution.

								</h6>

						<div class="coursecard-wrap">
							<div class="coursecard">
								<h2>MA35100 - </h2>
								<h3>Elementary Linear Algebra</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>This course was a wonderful introduction into what I call "creative math." As opposed to calculus, where many of the problems followed a formulaic procedure,
									this course had me thinking carefully about every problem. While many of the basic linear algebra topics and concepts were covered, this course had a focus on proving
									a variety of theorems and more abstract linear algebra topics. I still think back to this course and appreciate how it has changed my perspective of more abstract topics
									in math. And especially how it convinved me linear algebra is one of the most beautiful and elegant subjects there is.

								<h2>CGT16300 - </h2>
								<h3>Graphical Communication and Spatial Analysis</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>This course was an introductory course in computer aided design and how to communicate ideas visually. The primary program used in this course was Catia, which was definitely
									a change from the autodesk ecosystem I had grown used to. However, I learned a great deal about good practices when it came to desigining and organizing parts, and I enjoyed
									the technical drawing aspect of the class.

								<h6>
									This course was Purdue First Year Engineering part two! While it followed the same basic outline of its first semester counterpart, there were more topics covered and put to use.
									This included some control theory and algorithms, angular momentum and velocity, as well as developing extensive Matlab models. I really appreciate the student these first year engineering
									classes have made me and I will never forget where I started.

								<h3>The Evolution of Ideas II</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>
									This course was the second half of the 8 week seminar I took in Fall 2019 called HONR19901. This time around, the focus was more on independent learning and research,
									as well as effectively managing a small group in order to complete various projects over the 8 weeks.

								<h2>HONR39900 - </h2>
								<h3>History of Aerospace Technology</h3>
								<hr>
								<h6>
									This course was a history of aerospace, from the first hot air balloons, to the future technologies that may one day make humans an interplanetary species. I loved this course because no
									matter how much I thought I knew a given airplane, I always learned something new. During this course we also built balsa wood gliders, explaining practically design choices like dihedral, aspect ratio, 
									tail planes vs. canards.

									and ask if he could teach it to me. The syllabus of MA26100 was rich with these kind of topics, with a variety of ones I did not know of as well. Overall, this class was great and I just love how geometrically
