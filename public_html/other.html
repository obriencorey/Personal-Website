		<div class="container">


			
			<h2>What is this site for?</h2>


			<p>A number of things! I feel I have numerous skills and passions which are not articulated most effecitvely on a resume, so I thought I would try my best


				to showcase them here. Also, it's just fun to make a website. I have learned a ton about making a website responsive, nice to look at, and overall good design practices.
				
				It is also nice to have an online portfolio that I can send to new people I meet online.


			</p><br>

			<h2>Why Aerospace Engineering?</h2>


			<p>Great question! The short answer is this: Anyone who knows me would say this is a rhetorical question. I live, breathe, and speak aerospace. It's hard to put into words just how much I love it,
				I would just say wanting to be an aerospace engineer has always been one of my goals.
				<br><br> 
				The long answer however, is for two very important reasons. 
				<br><br>
					The first, and arguably more important, is that I want to inspire future generations of innovators much like
					past engineers have motivated me. For example, I'm sure when Lockheed was making the SR-71, they did not have my feelings in mind. But that piece of technology has made me want to push
					the envelope even further! I want to continue adding to the collective wealth of knowledge because one day we will need it. Earth has a time limit and the sooner we begin to become
					multiplanetary, the better. I doubt I will be the one to work on this technology, but maybe I will work on something that will inspire someone who will work on something that will inspire
					someone who will... ...work on this technology. That is my hope at least. 
				<br><br>
				The second reason is because I like solving problems. I like being challenged with something few people have been challenged with. I regularly do things my own way just to have a taste
				of this feeling. I like a hard problem, and aerospace is full of them. School has been just a tiny taste of what is in store and I am excited for the future!
			</p><br>

			<h2>Favorite Plane?</h2>


			<p>All of them! I can't pick a favorite, but some of the best in my opinion are the English Electric Lightning, the Dassault Falcon 8x/9x, the 
				Boeing 777-300ER (specifically the Air Canada light blue livery), anything made by Burt Rutan or Scaled Composites (I don't make the rules, they are just super cool),
				the Boeing 757-300, the Lockheed Model 12, the North American XB-70, the Martin	Marietta X-24A, the Diamond DA-42, and many more. In other words, all planes.
			</p><br>

			<h2>Favorite Rocket?</h2>


			<p>Another hard one! Although, there is much less variety here. I would have to go with the Little Joe rockets used in the Apollo program. It just looks like something a little
			   kid would design but served an essential purpose in the Apollo program. 
			</p>

			<h2>Career Goals?</h2>


			<p> I find this is a related question to the "Why Aerospace?" one, but I do have some distinct goals. I would like to specialize in structures and materials and do some research
				within that discipline during my undergraduate studies. I would also like to get a Master's Degree in AAE, with a potential focus on structures and materials. I would then
				like to work for a company who is pushing the limits of what is possible. Whether that means working on revolutionary spacecraft, building the next generation of efficient air travel,
				or anything in between, I would love it. I'm just looking for some problems to solve that would make a difference.
