					<h1> AAE20400 - </h1>


							<h3> Aeromechanics II</h3>


								<p>This course is the mechanics of materials. Stress and strain, Young's modulus, Poisson's Ratio and many more amazing
								   topics are what I covered in this class and it was among some of the most intersting material I have 
								   learned at Purdue. This course has made me consider possibly making materials and material sciences my specialization for the rest of my schooling
								   and beyond. I have always been interested in different materials and their uses. 
								</p>


					<h1> AAE20401 - </h1>


							<h3> Aeromechanics II Lab</h3>


								<p>This course was my first official aerospace lab. It was hard hard to comprehend that I would be doing real engineering in a Purdue lab, I simply
									never thought I would have such an amazing opportunity. This class incorporated 6 labs which built off of material learned in the course AAE20400,
									such as using strain gauges, deformation of materials under loads, and bending beams. This course was a great introduction to hands-on engineering and I had a ton of fun
									loading trusses and breaking tensile specimens.
								</p>			


								


					<h1> AAE25100 - </h1>


							<h3> Introduction to Aerospace Design</h3>


								<p>This course was a sophomore design project class which put fellow engineering students in groups to design either a
									space or air system. I chose the aircraft, since I felt that atmospheric flight has more room for creative spin and variance.
									How much flare can you add to a tube that needs to be as aerodynamic as possible? Granted, the flight profile of a rocket is many orders
									of magnitude more difficult than an airplane, but still. Also, I happened to own the first edition of
									the textbook required for this course! That was a pleasant surprise and a good indicator to me that I was in the right place.
								</p>


					<h1> EAPS10600 - </h1>


							<h3> Geosciences Cinema</h3>


								<p>Required for one of my niche Purdue general education requirements, this course was chosen because the professor was historically known to
									be one of the best at Purdue. Despite this not being one of my major classes, I still enjoyed the material and appreciated the acknowledgement
									that many people taking this course were taking it because they had to. Despite this, I learned a great deal and had a ton of fun. I now know why
									hurricanes don't form at the equator. 
								</p>


					<h1> ENGR29600 - </h1>


							<h3> Honors Peer Mentoring</h3>


								<p>This course allowed experienced engineering students to give back to the program by mentoring new students. I was given four students
									to support through their first semester at Purdue and more importantly, their first semester as engineering students. I emphasized
									my points of failure, encouraging them to embrace their own and to learn as much as they can from failure. It has always been a goal 
								for me to give back to the program which has given me so much and this was a great chance to do so. </p>


					<h1> MA26600 - </h1>

							<h3> Ordinary Differential Equations</h3>

								<p>The polar opposite of the other math class I took in Fall of 2020, differential equations are the langauge of engineers.
									Mathematical models which describe the real world are often ugly and cannot be solved. Many times, approximation is good enough
									and certain methods of approximation are useful to determine various characteristics of the physical world. I have a great deal of
									prior experience with differential equations but I was excited to have a formal course. We learned various methods to solve first order equations, some useful
									techniques and approximation methods, and finally ended the semester with a great deal of second order equations.
								</p>

					<h1> MA34100 - </h1>

							<h3> Foundations of Analysis</h3>

								<p>The first thing my professor said to the class on our first day was "if you are an engineer, you are going to hate this class."
									I actually chose to take this class though, as it is not part of the aero curriculum and I enjoy math. To me, analysis falls into
									a category of math which I call "creative math." This is a type of math that requires beautiful rigor and succicntness and is not the
									familiar memorize-a-formula-and-apply-it kind of math. Math is a beautiful story of logic and reason and real anaylsis is the first chapter.

					<h2 class="section-title mb-5" id="SUM2020">Summer 2020</h2>


					<h1> ENGL42100 - </h1>


							<h3> Technical Writing</h3>


								<p>(Course Taken at Community College of Allegheney County) This course was one of the few courses I would be able to take over the Summer of 2020.


									Due to a scholarship that could only be used in the state of Pennsylvania, I took this class to be able to take higher level aero classes at Purdue later on.


									This was a great class that taught many important soft skills that will prove to be essential as an engineer. I also just enjoy writing. It's fun to shape and mold words
									to represent exactly what you are thinking.


								</p>


					<h1> ECON25100 - </h1>


							<h3> Microeconomics</h3>


								<p>(Course Taken at Community College of Allegheney County) This course was the principles of economics and a variety of economic theory. I enjoyed this class


									because while I had a great intuition about many of the relationships in economics, there was some simple ways to thoroughly explain those relationships which I


									found elegant. Economics was cool and the readings for the class were interesting. I learned a lot of history as well, many events of which demonstrated the key concepts
									we were learning in class.


								</p>


					<h1> PHYS24100 - </h1>


							<h3> Electricity and Optics</h3>


								<p>(Course Taken at Bucks County Community College) This class was only offered at one community college in Pennsylvania, which explains why I am taking it at a school near Philly.


									This course is similar to an undergraduate electricity and magnetism course with some additional discussion of light and optics. I enjoyed the material, but I felt the textbook wasn't spectacular.
									For example, it spent little time discussing the theory but spent several pages showing you how to solve for the electric field of a charged hexagonal prism. 


								</p>


					<h1> AAE20300 - </h1>


							<h3> Aeromechanics I</h3>


								<p>This was my first AAE course at Purdue! Since it was a Summer course it was taught at an accelerated rate. This class taught
									many of the fundamental physics concepts which are invaluable to an aerospace engineer. We also learned the "Basic Kinematic Equation,"
									a Purdue coined term for a simplication of Euler equations for motion. Additionally, this course introduced statics and solving for reaction forces,
									a skill that would be essential for AAE20400. Statics has been one of my favorite topics, as the problems are often methodical and fun to solve. They do require
									you to be careful however, as they're just a big system of equations.
								</p>

					<h2 class="section-title mb-5" id="S2020">Spring 2020</h2>


					<h1> ME20000 - </h1>


							<h3> Thermodynamics I</h3>


								<p>


									This course was one of my favorite at Purdue! Known for being notoriously hard, I took this course two semesters early as I had already finished a great


									number of first year engineering required classes. This course was one of the first times I felt like I was actually learning engineering. I learned both the First


									and Second Law of Thermodynamics, as well as powerful concepts that can be used to analyze real life systems. Most of all, I learned how to look at a complex problem fundamentally and 
									think carefully about my steps to finding a solution.


								</p>


					<h1> MA35100 - </h1>


							<h3> Elementary Linear Algebra</h3>


								<p>


									This course was a wonderful introduction into what I call "creative math." As opposed to calculus, where many of the problems followed a formulaic procedure,


									this course had me thinking carefully about every problem. While many of the basic linear algebra topics and concepts were covered, this course had a focus on proving


									a variety of theorems and more abstract linear algebra topics.


								</p>


					


					<h1> CGT16300 - </h1>


							<h3> Graphical Communication and Spatial Analysis</h3>


								<p>


									This course was an introductory course in computer aided design and how to communicate ideas visually. The primary program used in this course was Catia, which was definitely


									a change from the autodesk ecosystem I had grown used to. However, I learned a great deal about good practices when it came to desigining and organizing parts, and I enjoyed


									the technical drawing aspect of the class. 


								</p>


					<h1> ENGR16200 - </h1>


							<h3> Honors Inroduction to Physics and Engineering II</h3>


								<p>


									This course was Purdue First Year Engineering part two! While it followed the same basic outline of its first semester counterpart, there were more topics covered and put to use.


									This included some control theory and algorithms, angular momentum and velocity, as well as developing extensive Matlab models.


								</p>


					<h1> HONR19902 - </h1>


							<h3> The Evolution of Ideas II</h3>


								<p>


									This course was the second half of the 8 week seminar I took in Fall 2019 called HONR19901. This time around, the focus was more on independent learning and research,


									as well as effectively managing a small group in order to complete various projects over the 8 weeks. 


								</p>


					<h1> HONR39900 - </h1>


							<h3> History of Aerospace Technology</h3>


								<p>


									This course was a history of aerospace, from the first hot air balloons, to the future technologies that may one day make humans an interplanetary species. I loved this course because no


									matter how much I thought I knew a given airplane, I always learned something new. During this course we also built balsa wood gliders, explaining practically design choices like dihedral, aspect ratio, 


									tail planes vs. canards.


								</p>

					<h2 class="section-title mb-5" id="F2019">Fall 2019</h2>


						<h1> HONR29900 - </h1>


							<h3> Architecture of Chicago</h3>


								<p>


									This course was one of my favorite first semester courses! During the first weekend in October, a handful of students took of a trip to Chicago


									to explore both the modern and historic architecture.


									During this trip, the architecture of Mies Van Der Rhoe was explored, as well as the social implications of his work.


								</p>


						<h1> CS15900 - </h1>


							<h3> C Programming</h3>


								<p>


									This course covered the C programming language, with various aspects such as pointers, user defined functions and dynamic memory allocation.


									Having already knew C before this course, it was a nice refresher, as well as learning some more features like conversion specifier widths and more.


								</p>


							<p></p>


						<h1> ENGR10301 - </h1>


							<h3> Engineering And Climate Change</h3>


								<p>


									This course was a 1 credit hour discussion based class that first centered around climate change related misconceptions and then on what individual


									efforts can be taken to reduce the impact humans have on the climate. This course was great, as I got to meet a number of different people from different


									majors all across Purdue.


								</p>


						<h1> HONR19901 - </h1>


							<h3> The Evolution of Ideas</h3>


								<p>


									This course was an 8 week seminar dedicated to thinking about how we think. This epistemology based course combined group work, an older student mentor,


									and self guided learning to create a dynamic envvironment where all ideas were heard.


								</p>


						<h1> ENGR16100 - </h1>


							<h3> Honors Introduction to Physics and Engineering I</h3>


								<p>


									This course was Purdue First Year Engineering part one! This is the course all first year students take before they transition to their respective major. This course coverd a variety


									of topics, but the most important lessons learned were soft skills. This included working as a group, having persistence when the class became difficult, 


									and learning how to have a holistic approach to problem solving. 


								</p>


						<h1> HONR19903 - </h1>


							<h3> Interdisciplinary Approaches to Writing</h3>


								<p>


									This course was an elective writing class offered through the Purdue Honors College. The main theme that the writing and discussion revolved around was the idea of the anthropocene,


									an era in which humans and their action are the primary forces acting on the planet. This class incorporated all of the best aspects of ENGR10301 and HONR19901 resulting in one of my


									favorite classes taken in Fall 2019. 


								</p>


						<h1> MA26100 - </h1>


							<h3> Multivariate Calculus</h3>


								<p>


									This course was as its name suggests, calclulus III. I absolutely loved this class. In highschool, I would often search math on wikipedia and math stack exchange, and then come to my calclulus II teacher


									and ask if he could teach it to me. The syllabus of MA26100 was rich with these kind of topics, with a variety of ones I did not know of as well. Overall, this class was great and I just love how geometrically

									intuitive calc III is.
